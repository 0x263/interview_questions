# Bloomberg Codecon Problems (Fall 2016)
These are problems from the Bloomberg Codecon in the fall of 2016. The numbers prefixing each file name is the point value of each problem; the higher the point value, the harder the problem.


## Requirements
The competition constrained time to 2 hours and allowed for problems to be completed in essentially any language. The solutions are completed in Python 3. Compiler details and competition requirements are shown below and are also available at the beginning of every file:
```
Language       : Python 3
Compiled Using : py_compile
Version        : Python 3.4.3
Input for your program will be provided from STDIN
Print out all output from your program to STDOUT
```

## Notes
The solutions may not be the most elegant or optimal.
